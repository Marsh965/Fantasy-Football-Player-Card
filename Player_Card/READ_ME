This Player_Card program was created to extract and analyze data from previous NFL seasons in order to predict breakout player seasons.
This project has an emphasis on the Fantasy Football side of things in order to help users expedite their research process.

Fantasy_Pros_Data_Get:
    This file must be ran first in order to web scrape the data from FantasyPros.com
    You can enter a single year or you can go ahead and scrape all supported years.
    The user is prompted to enter a year to stat grab all necessary data in csv format in order to run the Player Card
        - Fantasy Leaders {year}
        - Fantasy Leaders Weeks 1-17
        - Team Targets {year}
        - Positional Projections {year}
        - Positional Football Stats {year}
        - Positional Snap Count {year}
        - Positional Target Data by Team {year}
        - ADP values for the upcoming year

Player_Card_Run:
    Once you have scraped your data you are ready to run the player card.
    The user is first prompted to again enter a year if the csv file for that year cannot be found
    then it will prompt the user to again enter the correct year or gives an option to terminate the program
    If the file exists in the directory then the user is prompted to enter a players name to analyze.
    The players name must be spelled correctly with a space between their first and last name.
    Names such as A.J., Smith-Schuster, and Beckham Jr. must have correct spelling or else they will not be found.

My_Functions:
    My file to pull functions from such as web scraping, data cleaning, and mathematical functions.

Known Issues/Bugs:
    1. Free Agents cannot be viewed
    2. Players who were traded in the off season show the targets from the team they were previously traded from
    3. Las Vegas Raiders target file does not exist on FantasyPros.com yet (Probably due to name change)
    4. The previously Washington Redskins are listed as WAS: Washington so it will need to be updated when name change is official
